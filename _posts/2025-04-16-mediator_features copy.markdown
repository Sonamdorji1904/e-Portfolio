# Building Better Databases: Normalization, Decomposition, and Beyond

When it comes to designing databases, simply creating tables and relationships isn’t enough. A good database design must be efficient, free from redundancy, easy to maintain, and flexible for future changes. This blog explores the principles behind good relational database design, diving into **normalization**, **decomposition**, and even **modeling temporal data**.

## Features of a Good Relational Design

A well-designed relational database should have the following characteristics:

1. **Separate Relation for Every Entity**  
   Each table should represent a single entity or relationship. Mixing attributes from different entities in one table leads to confusion and inefficiency.

2. **Minimize Null Values**  
   Tables should be designed to avoid unnecessary NULLs. Attributes that often don't apply can be split into separate tables.

3. **Avoid Spurious Tuples (Lossless Decomposition)**  
   Bad designs can result in erroneous tuples when performing JOIN operations. Using **lossless decomposition** ensures meaningful and correct join results.

4. **No Redundancy**  
   Redundancy wastes storage and introduces the risk of inconsistency during updates.

5. **No Modification Anomalies**  
   Poor designs often suffer from:
   - **Update anomalies** (inconsistent updates)
   - **Deletion anomalies** (unintended loss of information)
   - **Insertion anomalies** (difficulty adding data without existing references)

## Decomposition and Normal Forms

To achieve a good design, we decompose large tables into smaller, well-structured ones using **normalization theory**.

### What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing a database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing poorly structured tables into smaller ones that meet certain "normal forms."

### The Key Normal Forms

- **First Normal Form (1NF):**  
  Attributes must be atomic — indivisible units like integers or short strings. No multi-valued or composite attributes.

- **Second Normal Form (2NF):**  
  No partial dependency of attributes on a subset of a composite primary key.

- **Third Normal Form (3NF):**  
  Attributes must depend only on the primary key — no transitive dependencies.

- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):**  
  Every determinant must be a candidate key. BCNF is stricter than 3NF.

- **Fourth Normal Form (4NF):**  
  Eliminate multivalued dependencies; one attribute should not depend on another if they're independent of each other.

- **Fifth Normal Form (5NF/PJNF):**  
  Deals with join dependencies and ensures that no redundant data arises from joining smaller tables.

- **Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF):**  
  Ultimate level where all constraints and data integrity are enforced.

## Functional Dependency Theory

At the heart of normalization lies the concept of **functional dependencies**. These describe relationships between attributes:
- If attribute X determines attribute Y (written as X → Y), then knowing X is enough to determine Y.
  
**Armstrong’s Axioms** provide a way to reason about dependencies:
- Reflexivity
- Augmentation
- Transitivity

We also have concepts like:
- **Closure of a set of FDs**
- **Canonical covers** (minimal, non-redundant FD sets)
- **Dependency preservation** (ensuring that after decomposition, functional dependencies are still enforceable).

## Decomposition Algorithms

### BCNF Decomposition Algorithm
- Iteratively find violations of BCNF and split relations based on those violations.
- BCNF decomposition guarantees **lossless joins** but may not preserve all dependencies.

### 3NF Decomposition Algorithm
- Uses a **canonical cover** to minimize redundancy.
- Guarantees **lossless joins** and **dependency preservation**.
- More flexible and practical compared to BCNF.

## Beyond Traditional Normalization: Multivalued Dependencies and Temporal Data

### Multivalued Dependencies and 4NF

Sometimes, even BCNF isn’t enough.  
For example, an instructor might have multiple addresses and multiple departments.  
Here, **multivalued dependencies** like `ID →→ address` emerge, and 4NF helps solve this redundancy.

### Project-Join Normal Form (5NF)

5NF or PJNF tackles even more complex redundancy arising from join dependencies. However, it's rarely used in practice due to complexity.

---

## Atomic Domains and First Normal Form (1NF)

Attributes must be indivisible:
- Instead of storing "Address" as a whole, break it into "Street," "City," "State."
- Instead of storing multiple phone numbers in one field, separate them into multiple fields.

Atomicity simplifies querying, reduces redundancy, and improves consistency.

## Database Design Process

How do we reach a good database design?
1. **Start with an E-R diagram.**
2. **Translate to relational schemas.**
3. **Normalize carefully.**
4. **Optionally denormalize** for performance optimizations.

Following consistent naming conventions and applying the **unique role assumption** also improves clarity.

---

## Modeling Temporal Data

In real-world applications, data often changes over time (e.g., instructor addresses, course titles).  
To model **temporal data**:
- Add `start_date` and `end_date` columns.
- Use **temporal primary keys** to avoid overlaps in valid periods.
- Enforce **temporal foreign keys** where necessary.

**Note:** SQL:2011 introduced some temporal data handling features, but full support is still limited.

# Conclusion

Database normalization is more than just a theoretical exercise — it's a practical tool for designing efficient, reliable, and maintainable databases.  
While concepts like 5NF or temporal modeling may seem complex, understanding the fundamentals of good design, functional dependencies, and normal forms empowers you to create systems that stand the test of time.
